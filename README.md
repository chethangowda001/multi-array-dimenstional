# Array Shuffling with Fisher-Yates Algorithm

This project demonstrates how to shuffle a multi-dimensional array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm with an Express server. It provides a web interface to shuffle the array and retrieve specific elements based on their row and column indices.

## Features

- **Shuffle the Array**: Randomly shuffle the elements of a 2D array.
- **Retrieve Elements**: Get the value of an element at a specified row and column in the shuffled array.
- **Web Interface**: Simple HTML forms to interact with the array and display results.
